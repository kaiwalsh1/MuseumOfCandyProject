# Museum of Candy Project

## Description

This project is part of a code-along activity through The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course by Colt Steele [Colt's Github](https://github.com/Colt).

This project is to practice using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. Starter code was provided and this project will build off of that.

It is a code-along project, but I will be attempting to recreate this page on my own, then going back and checking the tutorial.

## Installation

All that is required is to add Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript CDN. [Access Bootstrap CDN Here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/#quick-start).
